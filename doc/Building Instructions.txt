Building Instructions

The Paleo Editor project has only been designed to run on 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. At this time, there has been no effort to
port the project to any other operating systems.

The Paleo Editor project was developed with the Microsoft Windows 64-bit
version of the Lazarus IDE, version 2.2.2 (dated 2022-07-10) and compiled
with the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) version 3.2.2.

In order to work with and compile the project, these tools need to be
installed onto your computer. Note: compiling this project on platforms
other than Microsoft Windows (i.e., Linux or Macintosh) has not been
tested.

The Lazarus IDE (along with the Free Pascal Compiler) can be founded from
SourceForce at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/

In addition to the Lazarus IDE, the Paleo Editor project used the third-
party component library MPHexEditor. The package can be found from GitHub
at:

https://github.com/michalgw/mphexeditor

This package must be installed into the Lazarus IDE. Installation
instructions can be found at:

Windows-based setup installers scripts have been prepared for Inno Setup
by JRSoftware. The required compiler can be found at:

https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php

This compiler must be installed onto your Windows-based computer in order
to build the Setup installer for both 32- and 64-bit version of the Paleo
Editor.
