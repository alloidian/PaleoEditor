The Paleo Editor

The PaleoEditor.exe executable can be installed anywhere
on your computer. 

Because the editor does not write into its local folder,
the editor may be installed under the usually protected
folders, like the Program Files or Program Files (x86)
folders, without the need to manage security issues.
The editor saves its configuration data in the user's
roaming AppData folder:

%APPDATA%\Paleo\Editor.json
